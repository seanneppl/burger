### Full stack burger database application

[Burger](https://burger-burger-sn.herokuapp.com/)

Burger is a full stack application that uses a simple ORM to interact with a database of burgers.

The main page allows users to add a burger to the database, using the user input as its name and setting a default
'devoured' status of false. The page displays each burger in the database on the page, either as a burger burger layer
(if 'devoured' is false) or as an item in the "burger burgers you've eaten" list (if 'devoured' is true).
The user can click on a burger burger layer to update the database and set the burgers 'devoured' status to false,
moving it into the list.

*Burger uses express, mySQL, handlebars, and JAWSdb.
